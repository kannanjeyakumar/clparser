# README

Just a python script to parse craigslist apartment listing data.

## Requirements
* python 3+ - tested on 3.1
* lxml

## Usage


ex: 
(todo: - yes fix the folder structure)

import clparser
text = "<data>" #text as 
info = clparser.ParseListingText(text)

---
info will be a dictionary
{
    "url": <link to cl page>, 
    "price": <1280>, 
    "cats": <Boolean>, 
    "address": <address>, 
    "dogs": <Boolean>, 
    "posted_on": <Datetime> #utc
}

any keys that are not found will not be present.


## TODO
